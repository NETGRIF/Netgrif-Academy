# HTML to PDF

HTML to PDF is a **simple one-step process-based application** that consists of three tasks. But only one task is presented to a user. In the first step, the user can fill the data form with a rich text area. Once he is done with that he can press a Next button that will transform this text into a PDF. After the next button was clicked a rich text area form is hidden and a file filed that consists of an output pdf file is shown.
